# LazyVStackGlitchExample

This repository contains a simple SwiftUI View with several nested LazyVStacks. These illustrate a glitch that sometimes occurs when scrolling upwards. As you can observe in the GIF below, an extra space occasionally appears. At times, this space may become less than intended, or cause the scroll to just jump.
